"""
Calculates a dogâ€™s age from a human age.
Asks the user for their age and allows for float values.
For the first 2 years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years.
After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.
Print the result in the format: "The human's age in dog years is ..." 

If the user enters a negative age,
prints "Age must be a positive number." instead of the dog's age.
