"""
Asks the user for the temperature and wind speed and
gives them a wind chill temperature.  Rounds to two decimal places.

If the user enters a temperature or a wind speed for which the formula
is not applicable, give them a message that politely tells them why
it does not make sense to calculate wind chill (too hot and/or no wind).

Allows for input of float values but checks the userâ€™s input.
